    <h1 className='text-3xl mb-12'>The Green Iguana: An Invasive Alien Species</h1>
    <p className='text-xl mb-12'>
      The Green Iguana (Iguana iguana), known for its vibrant green coloration and distinctive dewlap, is a reptile native to Central and South America. It is a species of lizard in the family Iguanidae, characterized by its long tail, strong limbs, and sharp claws. Historically, it has been a popular pet due to its docile nature, but its introduction into non-native habitats has led to significant ecological and economic challenges.
    </p>
    <p className='text-xl mb-12'>Several factors contribute to the Green Iguana's status as an Invasive Alien Species (IAS):</p>
    <ul className='flex flex-col text-left'>
      <li className='mt-3'><strong>Introduction as Pets: </strong>The pet trade is a major contributor to the spread of Green Iguanas outside their native range. Their appeal as pets, coupled with their relatively easy care, has led to their introduction into numerous countries, primarily in the United States and the Caribbean.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'><strong>Escape and Release: </strong>Many individuals are released into the wild when they become too large or difficult to manage as pets. This deliberate release, combined with accidental escapes, has established breeding populations in various regions.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'><strong>Habitat Adaptability: </strong>The Green Iguana's adaptability to various habitats, including urban areas, agricultural lands, and natural ecosystems, has facilitated its invasion and establishment in non-native environments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className='text-xl mb-12'>As an IAS, the Green Iguana poses significant economic and ecological threats:</p>
    <ul className='flex flex-col text-left'>
      <li className='mt-3'><strong>Agricultural Damage: </strong>In areas where they are established, Green Iguanas are known to feed on a wide range of plants, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. This consumption can lead to crop damage and significant economic losses for farmers and agricultural industries.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'><strong>Ecological Impact: </strong>The Green Iguana's herbivorous diet and ability to thrive in diverse habitats make it a formidable competitor for native species. Their presence can lead to the displacement or decline of local flora and fauna, disrupting ecosystems and biodiversity.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'><strong>Health Risks: </strong>In addition to their ecological and economic impacts, Green Iguanas can also pose health risks to humans. They can carry parasites and diseases that can be transmitted to humans and other animals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className='text-xl mb-12'>In conclusion, while the Green Iguana is a fascinating and beautiful species in its native range, its introduction into non-native environments has led to it being classified as an Invasive Alien Species. Its establishment in these areas poses a range of economic, ecological, and health challenges that require careful management and control measures.</p>
